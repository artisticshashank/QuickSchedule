# WonderOS Scheduler Simulator 🎮🧠

A gamified, cinematic simulator for visualizing CPU scheduling algorithms — built with Flutter, powered by WonderOS.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Race Mode**: Watch processes compete in real-time with animated scheduling.
- 📊 **Gantt Mode**: Classic timeline visualization with branded transitions.
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Easily plug in new algorithms or themes.
- 🤖 **AI Assistant (optional)**: Chatbot support for explaining scheduling theory.
- 🎨 **Cinematic Branding**: Custom splash screens, transitions, and UI themes.

## 🧠 How It Works

WonderOS simulates core CPU scheduling algorithms with visual flair:

| Algorithm | Visualization | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| FCFS      | Linear race track | Processes run in arrival order |
| SJF       | Dynamic sprint lanes | Shortest jobs take the lead |
| RR        | Circular relay | Time slices rotate among processes |
| Priority  | Tiered podiums | High-priority processes dominate |
| Custom    | Branded themes | Plug in your own logic and visuals |

Each mode is backed by a modular Dart engine that calculates scheduling metrics and animates process flow in real time.
